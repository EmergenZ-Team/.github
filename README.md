<p align="justify"><strong>EmergenZ</strong> is an application designed to assist the community in responding to incidents that may occur at any time. Our application provides real-time information, alerts, and emergency response on incidents that frequently occur in Indonesia, such as traffic accidents, earthquakes, floods, and home or building fires. Additionally, our application is equipped with features to help users take appropriate action during an incident.</p>
<p align="justify">We conducted a survey on public awareness of emergency call service numbers, and they reported that it is difficult to remember emergency numbers due to the lack of information they know and panic during emergency situations. They also reported that sometimes they cannot be connected immediately when the emergency number is dialed.</p>
<p align="justify">As a final result, we made an Android Application that will help people and the community in emergency situation.</p>
